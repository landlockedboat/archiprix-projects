# [Solar energy research center](http://www.archiprix.org/2019/?project=4491)
"Solar Energy Research Centre" is situated on the site of an abandoned scientific research centre “Aragats”. The old Research centre was founded in the 1970’s and it is part of the research centre of Radiophysics of Armenia. The site is important in the scientific field, as one of the biggest radio-optical telescopes in the world  ROT 54/2.6 is situated here.  Also here is experimental solar station Sun-100 which is not finished due to financial problems. 
Center has territory almost equal to 58 hectares. 
“Solar energy research centre” is the first step of rehabilitation and development of the centre. The project aims of creating the centre which is part of an international scientific society. 

The Project has two main functional directions such as social and scientific. The social direction includes hotels, apartments for scientists and their families, conference halls, expo halls, restaurant and café. As it is intended to collect social activities to the centre. Scientific direction has two main parts: Research(laboratories) and Fablab.

The composition of the complex was inspired by properties of Photons which are called “wave-particle duality”, where photons behave as the particles and the waves at the same time. SImplified hexagonal grid( projected on the relief) was used to imitate the Lightwave. On the parallel sides of the hexagonal grid were formed 7 main blocks.  They are interconnected by the systems of ramps. They also serve as resting zones. This scheme is fostering interaction between scientist from different scientific groups. Laboratories were designed by the principle of “Open Labs”, as they can be transformed for the needs of specific scientific groups or tasks.
