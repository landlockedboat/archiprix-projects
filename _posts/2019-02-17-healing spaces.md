# [HEALING SPACES](http://www.archiprix.org/2019/?project=4445)
Spatial design of volumes came as a reflection of the references encountered during the diploma study. Initially, the purpose through composing was the creation of a fragmented unit in some parts to avoid long corridors - encountered in any project so far presented. As a result, the short link is made with the concept of "village" idea where a continuation of the inhabited area is felt, rather than the intervention of a single unit. This helped to create spatial narrative.

In this project an important role plays the creation of a narrative that is sometimes different for someone who is part of experiencing these spaces. Thus, different volumes are proposed as "organs" where each one functions is complex as an "organism" with other units to create the proper functioning of this system which, in addition to the functional connection with other objects, is reinforced by the physical connection created by a ramp system and the stage where the selected greenery makes the manifestation of this narrative that starts from inside and out and vice versa.

The thematic selection of external spaces that are part of the design of these SURFACE units is made by considering the sensory elements through which mental treatment becomes more possible. Thus, architectonic elements are created that promote mental curiosity and stimulate the desire to experience the spaces as well as reinforce the presence of sensory senses in human existence.
Reinforcement becomes present by architectural and natural element that are sometimes more apparent.
In the taxonomy of the external spaces are listed tiles which during their implementation in the spatial composition take another form to adapt to the project as well as to reinforce the feeling of atmospheric spaces.

For the reinforcement of the sensory relationship, extra elements stimulate the sense of interaction and reinforce it.
